🖋️ This project is the real project where I first started the software. 
I wrote the most used library functions in this project by thinking about myself. 
What we did was rebuild a library. 
The reason I did this was to use the functions I produced here in future projects in Ecole 42. 
By learning the names and functions of these functions together, I have laid a good foundation to be able to use these functions quickly in my similar function needs. 
It was the first project where I gained my algorithm skills. 
The fact that this project is in C language gives me comfort in learning other languages. 
It is one of the most educational projects of Ecole 42 Schools. 
I learned to use makefile and library for the first time in this project. 
In the main codes in the comment line, I used some Turkish concepts to grasp the topics faster. 
I may have used some outlines unnecessarily since it was my first project. After all, this was my first project. 
I successfully got approval from 42 Test Users. 
The reason I got 125/100 points is that I have successfully completed the "Linked List", which is the bonus part.

📈 The gains I gained while doing this project were: Algorithm Development Gain, Deep Pointer Concept, Linked List, Recursive Functions, File Descriptors, Write, While, If & Else blocks.

📅 Date I developed the project: Feb 2022. (My upload date to Github is March 2023)

💁 My advice to Ecole 42 students is to write all the functions in this project yourself. 
If you get the functions in this project from other people's githubs, you won't be making good progress on the school's remaining projects. 
This is one of the school's most important projects. 
Even if you look at other codes, when they are all finished, you should rewrite all functions and main lines without looking at any code. 
If you cannot do this, try again. Then again, then again...

🙏 Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mkaramuk" target="_blank">Muhammed Karamuk</a> who gave me great support in this project. You are a great person.
